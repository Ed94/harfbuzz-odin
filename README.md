# harfbuzz-odin

Harbuzz bindings for odin.  

Its not the full amount, just enough to utilize its base shaping functionality.

## scripts/build.ps1

I only have support for building on Windows (for now).  
Will pull the latest source from the harfbuzz repository and build requisite libraries. Adjust the code as needed, by default a custom unity build is done (see `Build-RepoWithoutMeson`).
